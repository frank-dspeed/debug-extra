# debug-extra
NodeJS Module using npm debug but Adds. debug.return() and debug.pipe() returns the values that get debuged Used for FRP and Stream Coding

## why?
Tbere was a time where i used only FRP code styles as i liked them the most. Today there are helper methods inside Nodejs to turn infos more easy into streams like iterators.
